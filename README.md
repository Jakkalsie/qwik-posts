- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) used by Qwik for fast build times
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as our CSS framework
- [tRPC](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-app-router) for end-to-end typesafety
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for our database ORM

## Project Structure

Inside of you project, you'll see the following directories and files:

```
├── public/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   └── ...
    └── routes/
        └── ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and `index.tsx` files as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

## Add Integrations

Use the `npm run qwik add` command to add other integrations. Some examples of integrations include as a Cloudflare, Netlify or Vercel server, and the Static Site Generator (SSG).

```
npm run qwik add
```

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). For Qwik during development, the `dev` command will also server-side render (SSR) the output. The client-side development modules loaded by the browser.

```
npm run dev
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite will request many JS files, which does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Preview

The preview command will create a production build of the client modules, production build of `src/entry.preview.tsx`, and create a local server. The preview server is only for convenience to locally preview a production build, but it should not be used as a production server.

```
npm run preview
```

## Production

The production build should generate the client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. Additionally, the build command will use Typescript run a type check on the source.

```
npm run build
```
